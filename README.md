Project Description: Interactive Dashboard for Analyzing Key KPIs (Sales, Margins, and Regional Performance)

This project involved creating an interactive dashboard to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), including sales, profit margins, and regional performance. The dashboard utilized data visualization techniques to provide insights into various aspects of the dataset, such as sales trends, profit by region, and discount effectiveness.

The key features of the dashboard included:

Sales and Profit Analysis: Visualizations for total sales, total profit, and profit margins, with breakdowns by region, state, and other dimensions.

Regional Performance: Heatmaps and bar charts for performance analysis by state and region.

Discount vs Profit: A comparative analysis of how discounts affected profit margins.

Top 10 Performing States and Regions: Rankings and visual comparisons of top-performing states and regions based on sales, profit, and discount levels.

Sales and Profit by Category: Breakdown of sales and profit by product category and sub-category.

Interactive Elements: Interactive charts and filters were implemented, allowing users to explore the data dynamically and gain deeper insights.

The dashboard was built using HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js for visualizations. It also included an upload feature, enabling users to load their own data and generate customized visualizations based on their specific datasets.
